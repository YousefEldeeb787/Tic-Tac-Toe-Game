# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. It allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 board. The program keeps track of the scores for both players (X and O), provides reset options, and integrates sound effects for win and tie events using the winsound library.

The main features include:

Interactive GUI with clickable buttons for each cell.

Win/Tie detection to determine game outcomes.

Score tracking for both X and O players .

Reset functionality (reset current game or reset all scores).

Sound effects for winning and tie situations.

This project demonstrates practical use of Tkinter for GUI development, basic game logic implementation, and multimedia integration in Python.
